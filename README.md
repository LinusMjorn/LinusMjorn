### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have recently greaduated from Makers acadamy in London. 

I have spent the last 4 or so years working in the property industry, but the more time I spent in the industry, the more I realised it does not align with my values.

I figured that switching career paths to software development would kill two birds with one stone, I could do something every day that I enjoy (Programming) and find a position in a copmany where I could give back to society.

I have recently finshed the Maker Academy bootcamp. It is heavily focused on Web Development using Ruby and JavaScript. During the course I built three apps. The first (BearBnb) was built using ruby and Sinatra, it can be found [here](https://github.com/LinusMjorn/AirBnB-Clone). The second (Robot Lizard) was also built using ruby but we also used the rails framework, I had no previous knowledge of rails before this. It can be found [here](https://github.com/LinusMjorn/acebook-robotlizard). For my final project at Makers, I decided to showcase my learning ability. We built an app in in JavaScript using the react framework. I had very limited exposure to JS and no exposure at all to react. My final project (BrewKanoo) can be found [here](https://github.com/LinusMjorn/brewkanoo).

I am currently improving my skills in both Ruby and JS.

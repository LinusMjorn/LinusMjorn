### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently working on an interactive website for the University Of Kent.

I have recently graduated from Makers Acadamy in London.

Before that, I have spent about four years working in the property industry. Over time, I realised that my ambitions lay elsewhere, and that I wanted to make a difference. I was already self-teaching coding skills using Codecademy and quickly developing a passion for it. I decided that switching career paths to software development would kill two birds with one stone, I could do something every day that I enjoy (programming), and work towards finding a position in a copmany that would allow me to give back to society.

I have recently finshed the Makers Academy bootcamp. The course is heavily focused on Web Development using Ruby and JavaScript. During the course, I built three apps. The first (BearBnb) was built using ruby and Sinatra, it can be found [here](https://github.com/LinusMjorn/AirBnB-Clone). The second (Robot Lizard) was also built using ruby and the rails framework. I had no previous knowledge of rails, but managed to quickly become comfortable with it and finish the project successfully. It can be found [here](https://github.com/LinusMjorn/acebook-robotlizard). For my final project at Makers, I decided to challenge myself and showcase my learning ability. We built an app in JavaScript using the react framework. I had only limited previous exposure to JavaScript, and no experience with react. My final project (BrewKanoo), which I am particularly proud of, can be found [here](https://github.com/LinusMjorn/brewkanoo).

I am currently further developing my skills in both Ruby and JS.

If you are an employer, my CV can be found [here](https://github.com/LinusMjorn/CV).
